# Big Data ecosystem

Hadoop tutorial inside the [Cloudera quickstart VM](https://downloads.cloudera.com/demo_vm/virtualbox/cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.13.0-0-virtualbox.zip).

## Prerequisites

#### Importing the Virtual Machine

Before working on the tutorial, we need a working Hadoop cluster.

For the following exercises, we will use the [Cloudera quickstart VM](https://downloads.cloudera.com/demo_vm/virtualbox/cloudera-quickstart-vm-5.13.0-0-virtualbox.zip).

* Download and unzip the applicance for VirtualBox.

* Import the `.ova` file into VirtualBox. **Don't start it yet** if you want to configure it.

  * You may configure the VM to use at least 6-8 Go of RAM, through the `Configuration > System` view. 

* Start the virtual machine with the green arrow.


The virtual machine should start and you should have access to a window. Do take note that the machine virtual by default is in QWERTY.

* To [enable copy/paste](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-copy-and-paste-in-virtualbox/), select `Devices > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional`.
* Open a terminal and type `setxkbmap fr` to temporarily change to AZERTY.

For the first part of the tutorial, we will interact with a [trucks geolocation dataset from the Cloudera tutorial](https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-hdp-sandbox.html). 



##  TD1 - First steps in the Hadoop ecosystem

For today, most of our interactions to the Hadoop cluster will be done through [Hue](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-13-x/topics/hue.html).

* Open Firefox : open a terminal and type `firefox` or `Applications > System tools > Web browser`
* Open the `Hue` tab. This will be our main UI for interacting with HDFS today. 
  * The credentials are **cloudera/cloudera**.



####  1. First steps on HDFS 

* We need to download and unzip the [Geolocation data from Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/content/dam/www/marketing/tutorials/getting-started-with-hdp-sandbox/assets/datasets/Geolocation.zip). 
  * You can do it from Firefox, download it to a folder in the virtual machine.
  * You can also `wget https://www.cloudera.com/content/dam/www/marketing/tutorials/getting-started-with-hdp-sandbox/assets/datasets/Geolocation.zip` and `unzip Geolocation.zip`.
* In Hue, select `Browsers > Files`. 
* Create a new directory in HDFS called `data` inside HDFS from Hue.
  * By default this should be created under `hdfs:///user/cloudera/`.
* Upload `Geolocation.csv` and `trucks.csv` into your newly created `data/` folder.



#### 2. HDFS CLI

* Open a terminal. 
* You can access the `hdfs` command from the terminal. This should output the help from the command line.
* Display the version of HDFS with `hdfs version`.

The `hdfs dfs` command gives you access to all commands to interact with files in HDFS.

* List all folders inside HDFS with `hdfs dfs -ls`. 
  * If you only type `hdfs dfs -ls` it will naturally take you to `hdfs:///user/cloudera`.  You should find your geolocation files.
  * By default if you don't put an absolute HDFS path, HDFS will start from your HDFS home `hdfs:///user/cloudera`.
* Rename the `hdfs:///user/cloudera/data` folder to `hdfs:///user/cloudera/geoloc` with `hdfs dfs -mv` . 
  * Remember by default that `hdfs dfs -mv data geoloc` is equivalent to `hdfs dfs -mv hdfs:///user/cloudera/data hdfs:///user/cloudera/geoloc`.
* Create a folder in HDFS named `test`. 
* To copy files from your local machine to HDFS, there is `hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal <local_file> <path_in_HDFS>`. Try to copy  your `geolocation.csv` file from the locall VM into the `test` HDFS folder.
* Currently, the `hdfs:///tmp` folder doesn't have permissions for everyone to write in. 
  In the Hadoop ecosystem, `root` is not the superuser but `hdfs` is. So we need to be in the `hdfs` user before running set permissions. Run the following script.

```sh
sudo su -
su hdfs
hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /tmp
```

_PS : don't forget to `exit` twice to go back to user `cloudera`, else you are going to have permission errors accessing the HDFS folders_.



#### 3. Map Reduce 

Now that storage is over, time to compute stuff.

* Run the Pi example : `yarn jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi 4 100`.  Observe the flow. You can check all logs in Firefox, in the `Hadoop > YARN Resource Manager` tab.

Now we want to run a wordcount on a file inside HDFS, let's run it on files inside `hdfs:///user/cloudera/geoloc/`. 

* Run `yarn jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount 
  geoloc/geolocation.csv output`.
  * The command may file if `hdfs:///user/cloudera/output` already exists, in that case remove the folder with `hdfs dfs -rm -r -f output`.
* Examine the `hdfs:///user/cloudera/output` folder. You can use `hdfs dfs -ls output` and `hdfs dfs -cat output/part-r-00000`. Explain
  * Also see the logs in a new tab to the favorite `Hadoop > YARN Resource Manager` in Firefox. Explain.

* Only one reducer is working there. You can edit the number of reducers running with the flag `-D mapred.reduce.tasks=10` . Edit the previous command to change the number of reducers working. You should maybe remove or change the name of the `output` folder.
  * Examine the output folder again. Can you note a difference with the previous execution ?



#### 4. Pig

Pig is an extension to compile Pig Latin, a specific language, into MapReduce scripts.

The following can be run in two ways :

1. Interactively through the Terminal, by launching a Pig shell with `pig `and run commands one by one.
2. In Hue, you can go to the Pig Editor via `Query > Editor > Pig`. This is the preferred method if you want to run full scripts but is much longer to run than the Pig shell.

*  Run the following script/commands to load and display the first ten lines from the geolocation file :

```
geoloc = LOAD 'geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid,driverid,event,latitude,longitude,city,state,velocity,event_ind,idling_ind);

geoloc_limit = LIMIT geoloc 10;

DUMP geoloc_limit;
```

* Let's try to compute some stats on this file. 

```
geoloc = LOAD 'geoloc/geolocation.csv' USING PigStorage(',') AS (truckid:chararray, driverid:chararray, event:chararray, latitude:double, longitude:double, city:chararray, state:chararray, velocity:double, event_ind:long, idling_ind:long);

truck_ids = GROUP geoloc BY truckid;

result = FOREACH truck_ids GENERATE group AS truckid, COUNT(geoloc) as count;

STORE result INTO 'results';

DUMP result;
```

* Analysis :
  * Check the `results` folder stored in HDFS by the `STORE result` line. What can you say compared to the MapReduce wordcount ?
  * Also see the logs in a new tab to the favorite `Hadoop > YARN Resource Manager` in Firefox. Explain.
* Are you able to count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid, and mean velocity per truckid ?



#### 5. Hive

Like for Pig, you have the choice between the `hive` command in the Terminal, or in Hue go to the Hive Editor via `Query > Editor > Hive`.

* If using the Terminal, create an external table for the `geoloc` folder which contains geolocation.csv. Maybe you should also move the `trucks.csv` file outside of the `geoloc` folder with `hdfs dfs -mv geoloc/trucks.csv`. The following command creates a Hive table pointing to a HDFS location. You can drop it, it won't destroy the data in HDFS : 

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE geolocation (truckid STRING, driverid STRING, event STRING, latitude DOUBLE, longitude DOUBLE, city STRING, state STRING, velocity DOUBLE, event_ind BIGINT, idling_ind BIGINT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/user/cloudera/geoloc';
```

```sql
SELECT truckid FROM geolocation LIMIT 10;
```

* Or with Hue, on the sidebar select SQL, click on the + button, and then manually select the CSV file.


* Are you again able to count the list of distinct cities visited per truckid, and mean velocity per truckid ?

  


#### 6. Impala

Apache Impala is an open source massively parallel processing SQL query engine for data stored in a  computer cluster running Apache Hadoop 

To save time during queries, Impala does not poll constantly for metadata changes. So the first thing we must do is tell Impala that its metadata is out of date. Then we should see our tables show up, ready to be queried: 

* Go to the Impala editor instead of Hive editor and run

```sql
invalidate metadata;

show tables;
```

* Rerun one of the SQL scripts you run before. Can you notice the speed difference ?

In the editor, on the left of results table you may notice a small graph icon. With this, you can visualize the results on a chart instead of a table. 

* Count the number of geolocations per trucks and display it on a bar chart.
* Select the truck `A80` and plot its geolocation coordinates in the Impala editor.



## TD2 - Unstructured data analytics

### Log exploration


Let's analyze some log files provided by the Cloudera VM. Those are provided locally in `/opt/examples/log_files/access.log.2`. 

_PS: if you are still stuck on this tutorial, you can consult the [original piece](https://www.cloudera.com/developers/get-started-with-hadoop-tutorial/exercise-2.html) to start._

* Import the data into HDFS, for example inside the folder `/user/cloudera/logs`.
* On HDFS, you can read the last data with `hdfs dfs -tail <path_to_file>`. Read the latest lines of the log file. What format is it ? How could you extract data from this ?

#### Impala analysis

Let's preprocess the Apache logs file with Hive before using Impala for analysis.

* Create an external Hive table `intermediate_access_logs`

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE intermediate_access_logs (
    ip STRING,
    date STRING,
    method STRING,
    url STRING,
    http_version STRING,
    code1 STRING,
    code2 STRING,
    dash STRING,
    user_agent STRING)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.contrib.serde2.RegexSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
    'input.regex' = '([^ ]*) - - \\[([^\\]]*)\\] "([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*)" (\\d*) (\\d*) "([^"]*)" "([^"]*)"',
    'output.format.string' = "%1$$s %2$$s %3$$s %4$$s %5$$s %6$$s %7$$s %8$$s %9$$s")
LOCATION '/user/cloudera/logs';
```

You may notice the difference with the previous table, we have changed the SERDE from CSV to regex. This SERDE is not provided by default, you need to add it via Hive with the following command :

```
ADD JAR /usr/lib/hive/lib/hive-contrib.jar;
```

* Let's create a table with the data preprocessed by the regex, so we can use it in Impala : 

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tokenized_access_logs (
    ip STRING,
    date STRING,
    method STRING,
    url STRING,
    http_version STRING,
    code1 STRING,
    code2 STRING,
    dash STRING,
    user_agent STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/tokenized_access_logs';

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tokenized_access_logs SELECT * FROM intermediate_access_logs;
```

* Update the metadata in Impala :

```
invalidate metadata;

show tables;
```

* Display how many times each product has been bought ?
* What percentage of `IP addresses`  went to checkout their basket ?
* If you case the date as a `Date` you should be able to build a web journey of an IP address on the website. For all IP adresses that went to checkout, compute the number of products each has bought before.

* **Bonus** - Try to connect your PowerBI to Impala, by connecting on `localhost:21000`.



#### Bonus - MapReduce code

You can find a [good Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3MssCo2eSU) on this matter.

* Open Eclispe. There you will find a `StubMapper`, `StubReducer` and `StubDriver`.

You can try to count how many times each product has been bought by completing those Stub classes. For that, in the `map` you must parse the log with the same regex as the Hive one, find if the url contains a product and put the product in key with value 1. 

* For that you will need to implement the `map` function in `StubMapper`, the `reduce` in `StubReducer` and the `main` in the `StubDriver`. The following are some examples :

```java
@Override
public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    String v = value.toString();
    for (int i = 0; i < v.length(); i++) {
        character.set(v.substring(i, i + 1));
        context.write(character, one);
    }
}
```

``` java
@Override
public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<LongWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    long sum = 0;
    for (LongWritable val : values) {
        sum += val.get();
    }
    result.set(sum);
    context.write(key, result);
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    int res = ToolRunner.run(new Configuration(), new StubDriver(), args);
    System.exit(res);
}
 
 @Override
 public int run(String[] args) throws Exception {

    Configuration conf = this.getConf();

    // Create job
    Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, "Job");
    job.setJarByClass(StubDriver.class);

    job.setMapperClass(StubMapper.class);
    job.setReducerClass(StubReducer.class);

    job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
    job.setOutputValueClass(LongWritable.class);

    FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0]));
    job.setInputFormatClass(TextInputFormat.class);

    FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));
    job.setOutputFormatClass(TextOutputFormat.class);

    return job.waitForCompletion(true) ? 0 : 1;
}
```

* Create a `.jar` out of the project with all dependencies.
* Run the code through the `yarn jar ...` command.



## TD3 - Analytics on scraped websites

#### Prerequisites

We are going to install a Python 3 setup to freely play with Pyspark on data in HDFS. Follow the instructions carefully !

###### Miniconda

* Install [Miniconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)

```shell
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda init # if you did not choose to init conda during install
```



###### Python packages

* Open a new Terminal. You should see _(base)_ at the beginning of the command line.
* Install all the packages inside the base environment _(let's not create a conda environment today, if your environment gets corrupted you can delete the VM and start over)_ :

```
pip install numpy pandas jupyter scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn requests beautifulsoup4 
```



###### Install Java 8

We need Java 8 to run Spark 2.0.

```shell
conda install -c cyclus java-jdk
export JAVA_HOME="/home/cloudera/miniconda3/jre"
```



###### Install Spark 2

* Look for the Hadoop version : `hadoop version`. It should be `2.6.0`
* Install Spark 2.4.5 prebuilt for Hadoop 2.6 :

```shell
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.5/spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz
tar -xvf spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz
sudo mv spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.6 /usr/local/spark
export SPARK_HOME="/usr/local/spark"
```

We should change 3 files below and replace Spark home path with new version’s path.

> /usr/bin/pyspark
> /usr/bin/spark-shell
> /usr/bin/spark-submit

So let’s change `/usr/lib/spark` to `/usr/local/spark` in the files

* Change the path to spark in the 3 files.



#### Test Pyspark install

* Launch a Pyspark shell :

```shell
pyspark
```

* Run some pyspark code :

``` python
sc.textFile("/opt/examples/log_files/access.log.2").take(10)
```

* Exit the shell and add path to Hadoop configuration files to access HDFS :

``` shell
HADOOP_CONF_DIR="/etc/hadoop/conf" pyspark
```
* Run some pyspark code :

```python
sc.textFile("hdfs:///user/cloudera/logs/*").take(10)
```

* Exit the shell `exit()` and relaunch the command but using the notebook this time :

```shell
HADOOP_CONF_DIR="/etc/hadoop/conf" PYSPARK_PYTHON="/home/cloudera/miniconda3/bin/python" PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS="/home/cloudera/miniconda3/bin/jupyter-notebook --port=9099 --NotebookApp.token=''" pyspark
```

This creates a Jupyter notebook on port 9099, you can access it on Firefox through `http://localhost:9099`.

* In your first cell you can try :

```python
sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()
def mod(x):
    import numpy as np
    return (x, np.mod(x, 2))

rdd = sc.parallelize(range(1000)).map(mod).take(10)
print(rdd)
```

Note how we use numpy inside a function inside a `map`.

**Beware :** actually this setup is not optimal because our Spark cluster doesn't run on YARN here so data from HDFS should normally not be accessible. But we are on a single node Cloudera VM so the data can be moved on the same machine and we are not going to manipulate huge data volumes so who cares ? In real life, Spark will be properly configured to HDFS.



#### Testing Pyspark on Apache logs

Let's analyze some log files provided by the Cloudera VM. Those are provided locally in `/opt/examples/log_files/access.log.2`. 

* Import the data into HDFS, for example inside the folder `/user/cloudera/logs`.
* On HDFS, you can read the last data with `hdfs dfs -tail <path_to_file>`. Read the latest lines of the log file. What format is it ? How could you extract data from this ?
* Run a test Spark function :

```python
sc.textFile("hdfs:///user/cloudera/logs/*").take(10)
```

* Let's apply the regex from our Hive exercise inside a Spark map to extract IP addresses. Run the following in a new cell :

```python
import re
p = re.compile('([^ ]*) - - \\[([^\\]]*)\\] "([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*)" (\\d*) (\\d*) "([^"]*)" "([^"]*)"')

def extract_ip(sentence):
    m = p.match(sentence)
    return (m.group(1))

rdd.map(extract_ip).take(10)
```

* Using this as base, compute how many times each product has been bought. 
  * Don't forget you can test your extract function on a single datum before going into the map function.
* We can extract all the data from the file into a Spark dataframe :

```python
import re
p = re.compile('([^ ]*) - - \\[([^\\]]*)\\] "([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*) ([^\ ]*)" (\\d*) (\\d*) "([^"]*)" "([^"]*)"')

def extract_all(sentence):
    m = p.match(sentence)
    return m.groups()

data = rdd.map(extract_all)
df = data.toDF(["ip","date","method","url","http_version","code1","code2","dash","user_agent"])
df.show()
```

* Now do the unstructured log analytics questions in pyspark on this dataframe :
  * Display how many times each product has been bought ?
  * What percentage of `IP addresses`  went to checkout their basket ?
  * If you case the date as a `Date` you should be able to build a web journey of an IP address on the website. For all IP adresses that went to checkout, compute the number of products each has bought before.

## Appendix

### Ambari installation

For the more adventurous one, there are other ways to install a Hadoop cluster :

* Download the [Hortonworks](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox.html) sandbox. https://archive.cloudera.com/hwx-sandbox/hdp/hdp-3.0.1/HDP_3.0.1_virtualbox_181205.ova.
* Using a cloud provider. On AWS, you can spin EC2 instances, so you can use your free AWS credits, or go on [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/).
* Using [Ambari](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Quick+Start+Guide)   . 
* Going full manual.

The following steps indicate my take on the Ambari method inside 3 generated VMs by Vagrant.



#### Setup Ambari cluster through Vagrant

```
git clone https://github.com/u39kun/ambari-vagrant.git
cat ambari-vagrant/append-to-etc-hosts.txt >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
cd ambari-vagrant
cd centos6.8 # ubuntu18.4

cp ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key .

vagrant up c6801 # u1801
vagrant up c6802 # u1802
vagrant up c6803 # u1803

vagrant ssh c6801 # u1801
sudo su -
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/ambari.repo http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/ambari/centos6/2.x/updates/2.6.2.0/ambari.repo
yum install ambari-server -y

# wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ambari.list http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/ambari/ubuntu18/2.x/updates/2.7.4.0/ambari.list
# apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 B9733A7A07513CAD
# apt-get update
# apt-get install ambari-server -y

ambari-server setup -s
ambari-server start
```

Once Ambari Server is started, open port 8080 on Virtualbox then hit http://localhost:8080 from your browser on your local computer.

Note that Ambari Server can take some time to fully come up and ready  to accept connections. Keep hitting the URL until you get the login  page. 

Once you are at the login page, login with the default username **admin** and password **admin**. 

###### Create a Cluster

Select HDP 3.1.4

On the Install Options page, use the FQDNs of the VMs. For example:

```
c6801.ambari.apache.org
c6802.ambari.apache.org
c6803.ambari.apache.org
```

Specify the the non-root SSH user **vagrant**, and upload **insecure_private_key** file that you copied earlier as the private key.

Follow the on-screen instructions to install your cluster. Just Install HDFS, YARN, Tez, Hive, Zookeeper,  Kafka, Spark, Spark2, Zeppelin, Ambari Metrics

Let defaults everywhere. Where you need to configure services put passwords everywhere.

 **vagrant suspend** and  **vagrant resume** when over.

When done testing, run **vagrant destroy -f** to purge the VMs.

**Recommendations**

If you would like to save state for a period of time and you plan to stop using your Mac during that time, if you sleep your Mac the cluster  should continue from where it left off after you wake the Mac. 

When stopping a set of VMs--if you don't need to save cluster state--it can  be helpful to stop all services first, stop ambari-server (`ambari-server stop`), and then issue a Vagrant `halt` or `suspend` command.

When restarting a cluster after halting or taking a snapshot, check Ambari server status and restart it if necessary:

```
ambari-server status   
ambari-server start
```

After logging into the Ambari Web UI, expect to see alert warnings or errors  due to timeout conditions. Check the associated messages to determine  whether they might affect your use of the virtual cluster. If so, it can be helpful to stop and restart one or more associated components.
